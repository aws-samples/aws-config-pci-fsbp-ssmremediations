# Remediations for PCI DSS 3.2.1 using AWS Config and custom AWS Systems Manager Automation Documents

Template 1 first provisions AWS Systems Manager Automation Documents as well as all the required pre-reqs. Template 2 then leverages the Systems Manager Automation documents within AWS Config Remediation Rules.


## COVERAGE

The solution provides remediations for the following PCI checks:
* [PCI.AutoScaling.1] Auto scaling groups associated with a load balancer should use health checks
* [PCI.CloudTrail.1] CloudTrail logs should be encrypted at rest using AWS KMS CMK
* [PCI.CloudTrail.2] CloudTrail should be enabled
* [PCI.CloudTrail.3] CloudTrail log file validation should be enabled
* [PCI.CloudTrail.4] CloudTrail trails should be integrated with CloudWatch Logs
* [PCI.CodeBuild.2] CodeBuild project environment variables should not contain clear text credentials
* [PCI.CW.1] A log metric filter and alarm should exist for usage of the "root" user
* [PCI.Config.1] AWS Config should be enabled
* [PCI.EC2.1] Amazon EBS snapshots should not be publicly restorable
* [PCI.EC2.2] VPC default security group should prohibit inbound and outbound traffic
* [PCI.EC2.3] Unused EC2 security groups should be removed
* [PCI.EC2.4] Unused EC2 EIPs should be removed
* [PCI EC2.5] Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 
* [PCI.EC2.6] Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs
* [PCI.IAM.1] IAM root user access key should not exist
* [PCI.IAM.2] IAM users should not have IAM policies attached
* [PCI.IAM.3] IAM policies should not allow full * administrative privileges
* [PCI.KMS.1] Customer master key (CMK) rotation should be enabled
* [PCI.Lambda.1] Lambda functions should prohibit public access
* [PCI.Lambda.2] Lambda functions should be in a VPC
* [PCI.RDS.1] RDS snapshots should prohibit public access
* [PCI.RDS.2] RDS DB Instances should prohibit public access
* [PCI.Redshift.1] Amazon Redshift clusters should prohibit public access
* [PCI.S3.1] S3 buckets should prohibit public write access
* [PCI.S3.2] S3 buckets should prohibit public read access
* [PCI.S3.3] S3 buckets should have cross-region replication enabled
* [PCI.S3.4] S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
* [PCI.SSM.1] Amazon EC2 instances managed by Systems Manager should have a patch compliance status of COMPLIANT after a patch installation

## How To Install

1. **Template 1 of 2:** aws-pci-systemsmanagerautomations.yml
* Provisions AWS Systems Manager automation documents. These documents are used to provide automated remediations within the provisioned AWS Config Rule.
* Provisions with fully built-in pre-reqs. No input parameters required. Simply install on the CloudFormation console (or CLI). Installs in approx 3-4 mins.

2. **Template 2 of 2:** aws-pci-configremediations.yml
* Provisions AWS Config Managed Rules and attaches the custom AWS Systems Manager automation documents as AWS Config Remediations to the AWS Config Managed Rule. No input parameters. Simply install on the CloudFormation console (or CLI). Installs in approx 3-4 mins.
* Leverages the output from the previous template specifically the AWS Systems Manager Automation documents
